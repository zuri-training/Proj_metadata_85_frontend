I made research about the project to make me understand what it entails prior the brainstorming process.
I was involved in the brainstorming process with the design team, where we discussed and understood the aim, use and importance of our project.
I made paper sketches for landing page, sign up and sign in, faq, and contact us pages.
I was involved in the design of low-fi wireframes of the web-frames.
