I was the design lead for my team so I was in charge of all the meetings we had.


I followed through to make sure design team members were assigned tasks. I made sure sketches were done by specific people, 
assigned tasks to someone for the video presentation, also made sure people specifically did designs the team needed

  
I gave finishing touches to all the pages we designed. Hi-fi , lofi and wifi


For the style guide I worked on the following : https://www.figma.com/file/pYV6mIkeXZg4n4ksXPBnOh/Team-85_Extract_Metadata?node-id=0%3A1
- colour scheme
- typography
- and general order and placement of things


Designed the following pages for our hi-fi mobile: https://www.figma.com/file/pYV6mIkeXZg4n4ksXPBnOh/Team-85_Extract_Metadata?node-id=26%3A3

- Dshboard
